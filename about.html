                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Hello! I'm Katie, a UX Designer based in Seattle, WA.
                    In June, 2023, I graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Human Centered Design & Engineering 
                    from the University of Washington and am currently working as an Associate UX Designer at iSoftStone.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>I believe in design that is not only visually appealing but also ethical, sustainable, inclusive, and accessible.
                    In my work, I strive to understand users' needs deeply and design with empathy and purpose.</p>
                <br>
